//Permutation.java

/*The PermAlg routine implements an algorithm that generates all n! permutations from 1 to n,
storing them in an array; this is accomplished through backtracking such that the invalid
permutations are skipped, and only the valid ones are printed. The variables are as follows:
n is the arbitrary number to generate all permutations; count keeps track of the number of
permutations generated; the array perm stores the current solution, which is printed 
when i = n, i.e. when a permutation has been formed; aux is an auxiliary array, that keeps track 
which numbers are already in the permutation, such that they do not repeat.*/
